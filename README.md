## Accordion Tabs
This element on the Style Guide is showing you how an accordion section should be laid out. The tabs should be responsive and should have functionality on click. 

## Flexible Cards
Cards should be laid out according to a grid and should be able to take up different amounts of columns. As the page shrinks, the different cards should take up the same amount of space.

## Header Bar
The header bar should contain all of its elements when the page is at its largest. When the screen becomes smaller the header should shrink to a user icon and to the word menu and, on click, should expand to give the user the options that are available.
